# Alphonse Mucha Keyboard for iOS support Page
Welcome, and Thank You for checking out the Alphonse Mucha Custom Keyboard app that I developed for iOS.

If you have any troubles using the alphonse mucha keyboard app and you are a registered developer on git, you can log any issues to me here personally and I can address the issue. If not, you can contact me directly at scott.t.yoshimura@gmail.com.

Known Issues:
-Left most edge side doesn't give visual indication of press
-Keyboard does not rotate on its own in Safari. You have to press the url bar to load the keyboard again.
